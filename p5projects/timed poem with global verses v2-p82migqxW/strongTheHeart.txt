when he heard
when she saw
and they walked
and walked on
the world was rounded
her hair let free
the rustle of her gown
something moved inside
he was dumb founded
then flew like a bird
without a word
around the world
all the seeds sown
the moonlight bright
the path unwound
she heard the sound
the night was warm
her soft smile
the wine spilled
his words garbled
lying in the grass
into the forest
he looks askance
slowly they dance 
her hands reached in
his hand, hers
as the omen clouds
both laugh softly
the moon so milky
the dark ripples
the muddy shoe
her soft breast
their loins mesh
his taut chest
and whom is who
it was time
they stole time
she stole a glance
and they walk
yes he knew
no she knew
always wondered
she always knew
and he too
wet clothes by river
wet skins shining
swam under moon
felt the current pull
dark ripples tug
diving into darkness
quiet splash heard 
inside quiet forest
below low moon
swim they swoon
all too soon
so close they climb
and we so weary
yet so alive we two
and we walked
they dive, they dive
is it you I crave ?
and you too 
and me too
so much she gave
the wave weakens
the current stronger still 
and its long wake
its long long wake
the stillness swill
bent knees twined
and soft words sent
taut and fraught
for nothing aught
giving nothing, all
we true, we turn
we grow, we burn
we yearn and yearn
and still we turn
birds flutter above
discarded glove
moon so bright
humming tune
strong the gloom
but great the heart
